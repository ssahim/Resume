					<p>Developer in public transport project where we used heterogeneous components to interact with each other. Three developers team were involved in the project. My team was working on the public transport component with the help of which we could find the best possible route to a location.

					<h3><img class="ecimg" src="images/b.png">Image deployment within Amazon AWS cloud</h3>
					<p>I was working as a scriptwriter to deploy and configure docker images in the Amazon cloud. In this project, my task was to write a heat template for the given topology. The topology consists of two front-end servers and five back-end servers. The frontend VM was hosting a two-fold replicated frontend HTTP service, while the two backends VMs were hosting a five-fold replicated backend HTTP service. The frontend service was exposed to clients and load balanced by a Docker networking feature. The front-end services were forwarding incoming requests to one of the backend VM using a hash-based load balancing strategy. Inside the backend VMs, Docker networking was again loaded balancing the incoming requests between the different backend service instances. </p>
